              collect information to assign each visitor a unique random number
              as a User Identification (User ID) to understand the User's
              individual interests using the identified computer. Unless the
              User voluntarily identifies himself/herself (e.g., through
              registration), cricfast has no way of knowing who the User is,
              even if we assign a cookie to the User's computer. The only
              personal information a cookie can contain is information supplied
              by the User. A cookie cannot read data off the User's hard drive.
              cricfast advertisers may also assign their own cookies to the
              User's browser (if the User clicks on their ad banners), a process
              that cricfast does not control.cricfast web servers automatically

              the Internet, including User's IP address, when the User visits
              the Portal. (User's IP address is a number that lets computers
              attached to the Internet know where to send data to the User --
              such as the web pages viewed by the User). The User's IP address
              does not identify the User personally. cricfast uses this
              information to deliver its web pages to Users upon request, to
              tailor its Portal to the interests of its users, to measure
              traffic within the Portal and let advertisers know the geographic
              locations from where cricfast visitors come.

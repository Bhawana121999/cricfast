            cricfast is a fantasy sports website where users can compete in many
            fantasy sports leagues like Fantasy Football, Fantasy Cricket, and
            Fantasy kabaddi! Users can build their own fantasy teams from a pool
            of available players and compete in tournaments. The success of a
            user's team is based on how its members perform in genuine athletic
            events.
          </p>
          <p className={style.mainh2}>
            Winning teams in each competition get prizes following the rules and
            guidelines of that competition. cricfast provides players with the
            option of participating in both weekly and daily fantasy sports
            games, with the latter allowing users to assemble new teams for each
            competition. cricfast can be played legally in most places because
            it is a game of skill. The user, however, must check local
            regulations.
